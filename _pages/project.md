**A Humanoid Robot Barista**
- End-to-end entire process of making coffee using humanoid robot Ginger and reinforcement learning, including clicking the button of the coffee machine, grasping the coffee cups and delivering the coffee to the designated place, etc
- Overcoming zero position error of 0-5 degrees and tolerance of target position offset
- Over 90% success rate in entire process in real Robot
- Actual deployment to the Dataa Robotics Showroom and reported by <a href="https://zqb.cyol.com/html/2019-06/18/nbs.D110000zgqnb_11.htm">China Youth Daily</a>.

**An Open-sourced Reinforcement Learning Platform for Robotic Arm**
- Based on Pybullet, using 6-DOF collaborative robotic arm + 2-DOF parallel gripper combined with reinforcement learning to complete multi-tasks, including static object grasping, dynamic object grasping, stacking, and inserting.
- All the tasks were deployed to the physical robotic arm and the success rate was over 95%.
